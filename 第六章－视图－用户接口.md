# Views – Designing the User Interface
This chapter will help you build the graphical interface for your applications. There are several different types of views and widgets available. The concepts of context and domain also play an important role for an improved user experience, and you will learn more about them.  

The todo_ui module has the model layer ready, and now it needs the view layer with the user interface. We will add new elements to the UI as well as modify existing views that were added in previous chapters.  

The best way to modify existing views is to use inheritance, as explained in Chapter 3, Inheritance – Extending Existing Applications. However, for the sake of clarity, we will overwrite the existing views, replacing them with completely new views. This will make the topics easier to explain and follow.  

A new XML data  le for our UI needs to be added to the module, so we can start by editing the `__openerp__.py` manifest  le. We will need to use some  elds from the todo_user module, so it must be set as a dependency:  

```xml
   {   'name': 'User interface improvements to the To-Do app',
       'description': 'User friendly features.',
       'author': 'Daniel Reis',
       'depends': ['todo_user'],
       'data': ['todo_view.xml'] }
```

Let's get started with the menu items and window actions.  

## Window actions
Window actions give instructions to the client-side user interface. When a user clicks on a menu item or a button to open a form, it's the underlying action that instructs the user interface what to do.  

We will start by creating the window action to be used on the menu items, to open the to-do tasks and stages views. Create the todo_view.xml data  le with the following code:  

```xml
   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <openerp>
     <data>
       <act_window id="action_todo_stage"
           name="To-Do Task Stages"
           res_model="todo.task.stage"
           view_mode="tree,form" />
       <act_window id="todo_app.action_todo_task"
           name=" To-Do Tasks"
           res_model="todo.task"
           view_mode="tree,form,calendar,gantt,graph"
           target="current "
           context="{'default_user_id': uid}"
           domain="[]"
           limit="80" />
       <act_window id="action_todo_task_stage"
           name="To-Do Task Stages"
           res_model="todo.task.stage"
           src_model="todo.task"
           multi="False"/>
     </data>
   </openerp>
```

Window actions are stored in the ir.actions.act_window model, and can be de ned in XML  les using the <act_window> shortcut that we just used.  

The first action opens the task stages model, and uses only the basic attributes for a window action.
