#Chapter 5 Models – Structuring the Application Data
********

In the previous chapters, we had an end-to-end overview of creating new modules for Odoo. In Chapter 2, Building Your First Odoo Application, a completely new application was built, and in Chapter 3, Inheritance – Extending Existing Applications, we explored inheritance and how to use it to create an extension module for our application. In Chapter 4, Data Serialization and Module Data, we discussed how to add initial and demonstration data to our modules.  

In these overviews, we touched all the layers involved in building a backend application for Odoo. Now, in the following chapters, it's time to explain in more detail these several layers making up an application: models, views, and business logic.  

In this chapter, you will learn how to design the data structures supporting an application, and how to represent the relations between them.  

## Organizing application features into modules 将应用功能组织到模块
As before, we will use an example to help explain the concepts. One of the great things about Odoo is being able to pick any existing application or module and add, on top of it, those extra features you need. So we are going to continue improving our to-do modules, and in no time they will form a fully featured application!  

It is a good practice to split Odoo applications into several smaller modules, each of them responsible for specific features. This reduces overall complexity and makes them easier to maintain and upgrade to later Odoo versions. The problem of having to install all these individual modules can be solved by providing an app module packaging all those features, through its dependencies. To illustrate this approach we will be implementing the additional features using new to-do modules.  

将Odoo应用分割到多个较小的模块就是一个最佳实践，每个

## Introducing the todo_ui module 介绍todo_ui模块
In the previous chapter, we  rst created an app for personal to-dos, and then extended it so that the to-dos could be shared with other people.  

在前面以后做那个，我们首先创建了一个人的todo应用，然后扩展它，以便能够与其它人共同使用。  

Now we want to take our app to a new level by adding to it a kanban board and a few other nice user interface improvements. The kanban board will let us organize our tasks in columns, according to their stages, such as Waiting, Ready, Started or Done.  

现在，我们想要

We will start by adding the data structures to enable that vision. We need to add stages and it will be nice if we add support for tags as well, allowing the tasks to be categorized by subject.  

The  rst thing to  gure out is how our data will be structured so that we can design the supporting Models. We already have the central entity: the to-do task. Each task will be in a stage, and tasks can also have one or more tags on them. This means we will need to add these two additional models, and they will have these relations:  

- Each task has a stage, and there can be many tasks in each stage.
- Each task can have many tags, and each tag can be in many tasks. 

This means that tasks have many to one relation with stages, and many to many relations with tags. On the other hand, the inverse relations are: stages have a one to many relationship with tasks and tags have a many to many relation with tasks.  

We will start by creating the new todo_ui module and add the to-do stages and to-do tags models to it.    

We've been using the ~/odoo-dev/custom-addons/ directory to host our modules. To create the new module alongside the existing ones, we can use these shell commands:  

```shell
$ cd ~/odoo-dev/custom-addons
$ mkdir todo_ui
$ cd todo_ui
$ touch todo_model.py
$ echo "from . import todo_model" > __init__.py
```
